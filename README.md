# Talento
Talento is a machine learning algorithm designed to streamline the recruitment process by analyzing resumes based on required skills and scoring candidates accordingly, categorizing skills into potential and additional skills to rank candidates from best to worst fit. The project includes a Python script for running the algorithm, with a user-friendly website under development to enhance accessibility for recruiters. The website is currently under construction and will be completed shortly. Future enhancements and learning opportunities are highlighted, welcoming feedback and collaboration for continuous improvement, all under the project name Talento, reflecting its focus on talent acquisition and optimization. For usage, users need to provide a folder of resumes and specify required skills, run the algorithm to score and rank candidates, and stay tuned for updates on the website interface.
